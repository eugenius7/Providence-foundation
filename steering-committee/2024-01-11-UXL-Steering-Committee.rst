Agenda
- Operational Procedures Final Review
- Working Group Priorities
- Goals and metrics for 2024

General
-------
Operational procedures are published as draft with final chance for 
review. A release branch has been created `on GitHub <https://github.com/uxlfoundation/uxl_operational_procedures/tree/release>`_ 
and this defines the current operational procedures for the foundation.
The members will continue to review and update these when required.


Working Group Priorities
------------------------

The groups previously discussed what the priorities should be for the 
two working groups - Specification and Open Source. A general 
summary of these was presented and discussed.

The Steering Committee will publish a set of more detailed priorities 
on the GitHub repository for the Working Groups.

The groups will meet on a regular basis, the intention initially is 
for the Open Source Working Group to meet every two weeks, and the 
Specification Working Group will decide the frequency when they meet.

**Specification Priorities**

- Project documentation for contribution and collaboration
- Roadmap for releases
- Best practices for community feedback on new APIs and designs

The Specification Working Group is planning the migration of the 
specification rendered content to GitHub pages from Intel internal 
infrastructure.

The group will also prioritise the alignment of how changes are shared 
for review. Some projects have a RFC process and others a variation on 
this.

A roadmap is already under discussion and will be published in due course.

**Open Source Priorities**

- Build & Infrastructure
- Open Source Best Practice
- Multi-Vendor Targets
- Open Source Kernels
- Architecture
- Compatibility Tests

Discussion points:

The structure of this group will need to be agreed by the members, it may 
be necessary to split this into multiple sub-groups as well as work packages.

Members can help to bring credits to the foundation for cloud environments 
that can be used for build and testing of any of the projects. 
(e.g. AWS, Google Cloud, MS Azure...)

The TensorFlow project provides the ability for commmunity members to hook their 
own infrastructure into the project to build and test on specific targets. This 
is something we should encourage for UXL projects. For example Intel already has 
a set of infrastructure for building and testing. Other members and contributors 
should be able to add their own.
