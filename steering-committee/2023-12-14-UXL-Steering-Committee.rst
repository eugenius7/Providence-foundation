General
-------

We welcome Ramesh from VMware to the Steering Committee.
Invitations for all the UXL Foundation meetings are now being managed by the 
Linux Foundation platform. You will receive an invitation to meetings where 
you are on the mailing list. If there are any issues please let Jory know.

Safety Critical SIG Proposal
----------------------------

Verena Beckham from Codeplay proposed a Safety Critical SIG for the 
foundation at a committee meeting in November.
The group considered this and agreed to approve the new SIG.
The necessary mailing list and other arrangements will be set up.

Working Group Participation
---------------------------

The leaders for the Working Groups has been appointed (Specification - 
Robert Cohn (Intel) and Open Source - Andrew Wafaa (Arm)).
All Steering members are requested to assing their representatives for 
these groups.
It is anticipated that the first Working Groups meetings will happen in 
January or February.

GitHub Repositories
-------------------

Currently all project repositories are living under the oneapi-src 
organisation on GitHub.
Robert Cohn is discussing with the project maintainers about a transition 
plan so that these can live under an UXL Foundation organisation(s).
The Open Source Working Group will work on this to ensure there is a 
smooth transition.

Operational Procedures
----------------------

A draft version of the UXL Foundation Operational Procedures has been 
published `on GitHub <https://github.com/uxlfoundation/uxl_operational_procedures/tree/draft>`_.
The group discussed the implementation of a 45 day waiting period before 
approval of a new specification version. It was agreed the new version can 
be published but will include a banner during the 45 day waiting period that 
indicates it is not yet approved. The changes will be made to the draft 
operational procedures.

Proposing and Adding new Projects to the UXL Foundation
-------------------------------------------------------

Discussion was had on how anyone might go about either proposing or 
adding a new project or specification to the foundation. 
The group agreed a lightweight process is required for this but in 
practice the topic should be brought to the Steering Committee. 
An issue was added and this will be added to the operational 
procedures.
